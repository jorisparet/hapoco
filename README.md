# Hapoco

**hapoco** (*handy pointing-stick controller*) is a Python application that allows you to control your mouse from your webcam using both hands, in a way that mimics a [pointing stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick). One hand controls the mouse cursor and the other hand performs basic actions, such as left click, right click, drag and drop and scrolling. It is designed to replace a traditional mouse by minimizing any hand or finger movement for accessibility purposes.

Quick start
-----------
